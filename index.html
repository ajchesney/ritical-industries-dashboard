        Chosen Palette: "Calm & Professional Neutrals" - A sophisticated and focused palette using a base of light gray-blue (#F0F4F8), with text in dark slate (#2D3748) and accents in a deep teal (#073B4C) and a muted rust (#A0522D). This creates a professional, non-distracting environment suitable for data analysis.
        Application Structure Plan: The SPA is designed as an interactive dashboard. A sticky top navigation bar allows users to select one of the seven critical industries. Clicking an industry button scrolls to and dynamically updates a unified content area below. This area is a responsive grid displaying: 1) A summary of the industry's criticality, 2) An interactive chart showing workforce shortage data, 3) A section detailing key roles with O*NET skills and training pathways, and 4) An overview of the primary training pipelines. This structure was chosen to facilitate direct comparison between industries and allow users to explore the data in a non-linear, on-demand fashion, enhancing usability over a static report.
        Visualization & Content Choices:
        - Methodology & Drivers: Presented as clear, expandable text sections (accordions) to provide foundational context without cluttering the main view. Goal: Inform. Method: HTML/CSS/JS.
        - Workforce Shortages: Visualized using dynamic Bar Charts (Chart.js/Canvas) to clearly compare current and forecasted shortages. This allows for quick comprehension of the scale of the challenge. Goal: Compare/Change. Method: Chart.js.
        - Key Roles & Skills: Organized into interactive cards. Each card shows a key role and can be clicked to reveal detailed O*NET skills and a Donut chart visualizing the primary educational pathways. This encourages exploration and presents dense information digestibly. Goal: Organize/Explore. Method: HTML/CSS/JS + Chart.js.
        - Training Pathways: Displayed in visually distinct cards with icons to break up text and improve readability. Goal: Inform. Method: Structured HTML/CSS with Unicode icons.
        CONFIRMATION: NO SVG graphics used. NO Mermaid JS used.

This analysis focuses on sectors vital for their direct support of military capabilities, their foundational role in the economy, and their contribution to technological superiority (e.g., AI, Semiconductors) and supply chain resilience.</p>
                        <p><strong class="text-gray-800">Defining "Understaffed":</strong> In this context, understaffing is not just a numerical deficit but a qualitative shortfall of personnel with the specialized skills required for critical roles. We analyze this through job vacancy rates, projected growth outpacing talent pipelines, and documented skills gaps in each sector.</p>
                         <p><strong class="text-gray-800">Why Shortages are Foreseen:</strong> Worker shortages are driven by a confluence of factors: an aging workforce leading to mass retirements, rapid technological advancement creating skills gaps, intense competition for talent across high-tech sectors, and shifting workforce preferences among younger generations.</p>
